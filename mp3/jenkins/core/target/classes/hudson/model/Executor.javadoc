isIdle=\ Returns true if this {@link Executor} is ready for action.\n
getCurrentWorkUnit=\ Returns the current {@link WorkUnit} (of {@link \#getCurrentExecutable() the current executable})\n that this executor is running.\n\n @return\n      null if the executor is idle.\n
getCurrentExecutable=\ Returns the current build this executor is running.\n\n @return\n      null if the executor is idle.\n
getProgress=\ Returns the progress of the current build in the number between 0-100.\n\n @return -1\n      if it's impossible to estimate the progress.\n
